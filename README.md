3 major takeaways:
1. Among the 4 drugs tested, Capomulin is the only drug that was associated with lowered mean tumor volume over the course of the 45-day treatment. For trials of Infubinol, Ketapril, and the Placebo, the mean tumor volume increased over the trial period.
2. For all four drugs, Capomulin had the lowest rate of metatatic spread over the treatment period. For all for drugs, metastatic spread increased over the treatment period.
3. Capomulin had the highest survival rate for test subjects among all four drugs studied. Capomulin has a survival rate of over 80% and the other three drugs have survival rates below 50%.
